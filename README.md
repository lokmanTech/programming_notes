# Ultimate Notes

A collection of notes and resources on learning Python & SQL, including code snippets, tutorials, and best practices. Ideal for beginners and enthusiasts to enhance their programming skills.

### Getting Started

Frankly speaking, I'm new to the programming world, coming from a completely different niche. But here I am, with one goal: making it easier for new learners!

My goal is to become a **Data Architect**, and Python and SQL play significant roles in this field.

In my case, I'm dividing these two tools into different categories Data Manipulation (python) and Data Management (SQL).

|Data Manipulation|Data Management|
|:---------------:|:-------------:|
|[Python](python.ipynb)|[DB](Database.ipynb#db)|
|[Visualization Techniques](python.ipynb#vt))|[RDBMS](Database.ipynb#rdbms)|
||[SQL](SQL.ipynb)| 


In this context, the specific programming language doesn't matter much; the essence is the sameâ€” **PRACTICE**.
