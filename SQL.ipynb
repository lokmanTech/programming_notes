    "# Introduction to SQL\n",
    "Discover a treasure trove of tools for data enthusiasts. Dive into databases, SQL, and essential data management techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "- SQL stands for Structured Query Language. As the name suggests, it is a structured language via which you can query the database for performing various tasks such as Storing, Manipulating, and retrieving data from a database.\n",
    "- SQL is the standard language when it comes to communicating with powerful relational databases such as Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft SQL Server, Access, Ingres, etc. Anything related to data in relational databases such as creating tables, limiting access to data, sorting, filtering, grouping, etc. is achieved using SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL v. MySQL: Difference Between Both**\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"img/sql-v-mysql.png\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most beginners usually get confused between the two terms - SQL and MySQL, and sometimes use the two interchangeably. However, there is a clear and vast difference between the two.\n",
    "- As defined earlier, SQL is a language that allows one to communicate with the database. MySQL on the other hand is an RDBMS in which you can type SQL commands to interact withthe database.\n",
    "- SQL is the language/protocol that is used by relational database management systems to allow users to manipulate data in the database.\n",
    "- MySQL is a database management system that provides users with an interface to connect with databases. MySQL provides users with the ability to create various databases, tables,stored procedures, functions in their database servers. SQL is the language that is used to perform powerful operations on the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Can SQL do?**\n",
    "SQL is one of the  powerful programming language that allows you to communicate with the database. Almost all companies use databases to store and retrieve data in some form or the other. Using SQL, you create Databases, and inside a database, you create various TABLES in which you can add all your data. Using SQL, you can:\n",
    "1. Create / Delete Databases\n",
    "2. Create / Delete Table(s) in a database\n",
    "3. `SELECT` particular data from table(s)\n",
    "4. `INSERT` data into table(s)\n",
    "5. `UPDATE` data in table(s)\n",
    "6. `DELETE` data from table(s)\n",
    "7. Create `Views` in the database\n",
    "8. Execute various aggregate functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to get started with SQL?**\n",
    "- To get started with writing SQL on your computer, you would need to install a Database Management Server. The RDBMS would then give you all the necessary tools to interact with your database.\n",
    "- There are various RDBMS that you can use, and it doesn't matter (much) what system you choose as long as it's working for you. Some of the most common RDBMS are:\n",
    "  1. MySQL\n",
    "  2. Oracle\n",
    "  3. Microsoft SQL Server\n",
    "  4. PostgreSQL\n",
    "  5. Heidi SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "Just install any of the RDBMS that you like from their official website and you should be able to create a database server by simply following their instructions. Once you have a database server ready, you can get access to a Query Editor where you can type all your SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Working with Tables**\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with SQL, you need to understand that data is organized into tables. One database would contain all the data for a single application (in most cases). A single database would have multiple tables that store values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:- If you have a restaurant management application or implemented E-Delivery solution for smooth operations, you would have a database that contains tables such as:\n",
    "  1. Customers\n",
    "  2. Orders\n",
    "  3. Menu Items\n",
    "  4. Receipts\n",
    "  5. ComBox\n",
    "\n",
    "Here visual example, for a clear picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"img/table(s)-eg.png\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- etc. Each table would contain a specific type of data and various tables could have different types of relations. Using SQL relations, we can combine values from different tables to fetch the data that we require. (More on relations in a later section).\n",
    "- To create a table, we would require two things. Firstly, we would need all the fields that we want to store in a table. Secondly, we want to define the type of data that would enter into a table.\n",
    "- Let's take the restaurant management application's Customers table as an example. We want to store some information about\n",
    "each of our customers such as their name, Phone Number, and Postal Code. Now that we are done with the first step, we need to define the data types of these values.\n",
    "The name of a customer would be of character data type because we need to store alphabetical characters. Similarly, the phone number would be characters again because we would need to store country code, and special characters such as '+', '()', etc. The postal code would be of type integer because we need to store numbers. Here is how the table would look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Name|Phone|Postal Code|\n",
    "|:--:|:---:|:---------:|\n",
    "|varchar(50)|varchar(15)|integer|\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify each customer uniquely, we add an ID to them so that we can use this ID to connect data from various tables. So, the final table structure could look something like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "|ID|Name|Phone|Postal Code|\n",
    "|:-:|:--:|:---:|:---------:|\n",
    "|INTEGER|VARCHAR(50)|VARCHAR(15)|INTEGER|\n",
    "\n",
    "To create this table, we would use the CREATE SQL Command followed by the fields as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`CREATE TABLE customers(`\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "`ID INT NOT NULL,`\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "`name varchar(50),`\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "`phone varchar(15),`\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "`postalCode INT`\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "`);`\n",
    "\n",
    " - To delete this table, we would use the `DROP` command as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`DROP TABLE customers;`\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL Data Type for Server**\n",
    "To create tables for manipulating data effectively, we need to work with the correct data type. Let's say we want to work with dates, it would be easier to create a column for holding DATE type values instead of storing them as a string and writing logic to manipulate the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"img/SQLDataTypes.png\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Every RDBMS is different and each RDBMS might have a different data type for working with certain values. The following sections of this SQL Cheat Sheet contain the various types of MySQL data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**String Data Types**\n",

    "**CRUD Operations with SQL\n",
    "Now that we have our table(s) ready, let's see how we can store and retrieve data from the tables in our database. In the following sections of this SQL Basics Cheat Sheet, we would look at the most basic SQL operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"img/CRUD.png\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "CRUD is an acronym that stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the most fundamental operations that one can perform on any database. For creating any application,these 4 types of operations are crucial. They are:-\n",
    "  1. INSERT (Create)\n",
    "  2. SELECT (Read)\n",
    "  3. UPDATE (Update)\n",
    "  4. DELETE (Delete)\n",
    "\n",
    "**INSERT**\n",
    "To insert data into any table, we use the INSERT INTO statement. The general syntax for insert is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`INSERT INTO table_name(column1,column2,...)`\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "    `VALUES (val1,val2,...);`\n",
    "\n",
    "To insert data into our customer's table, we would use the following statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "`INSERT INTO customers(ID,name,phone,postalCode)`\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "    `VALUES(1,'Alice','+123456789',123456);`\n",
    "\n",
    "**SELECT**\n",
    "To read data from a table, we would use the Select statement where we define the columns that we want to fetch. The general syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT column1,column2,.. FROM table_name;`\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to select the name and phone number of a customer from our table, we would use:\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT name, phone FROM customers;`\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, to read all the columns from our table, we can replace the column names with * as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT*FROM customers;`\n",
    "\n",
    "**UPDATE**\n",
    "To update specific column(s) of specific row(s), we make use of the Update statement. The general syntax for an update statement is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`UPDATE table_name\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  `SET column1=value1,column2=value2,...`\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  `WHERE conditions...;`\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we wanted to update the phone number of a customer that has an ID of 2, we would write our query as:\n",
    "\n",
    "`UPDATE customers`\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  `SET phone='+2223334445'`\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  `WHERE ID=2;`\n",
    "\n",
    "We can update multiple columns by adding them to the SET statement and we can target multiple rows by adding them to the WHERE statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DELETE**\n",
    "If we wanted to remove some rows from a table, we would use the delete statement. The general syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`DELETE FROM table_name`\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  `WHERE condition...;`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we want to remove all the customers who live in a particular area. So, we simply delete those rows that have a specific area code:\n",
    "\n",
    "`DELETE FROM customers`\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  `WHERE postalCode=223344;`\n",
    "\n",

    "|IS NULL|Tests for empty (NULL) values. Eg: SELECT * FROM users WHERE phone IS NULL;|\n",
    "|IS NOT NULL|Opposite of IS NULL. Tests for values that are not null.|\n",
    "|LIKE|Returns true if the operand value matches a pattern. SELECT * FROM users WHERE first_name LIKE '%son';|\n",
    "|ORDER BY|Used to sort the resultant data in ascending (default) or descending order.|\n",
    "|SELECT DISTINCT|Same as SELECT, except duplicate values are excluded. Eg: SELECT DISTINCT postalCode from customers;|\n",
    "|TOP|Used alongside SELECT to return a set number of records from a table. Eg: SELECT TOP 5 * FROM customers;|\n",
    "|VALUES|Used alongside the INSERT INTO keyword to add new values to a table. Eg: INSERT INTO cars (name, model, year) VALUES ('Ford', 'Fiesta', 2010);|\n",
    "|WHERE|Filters result only includes data that meets the given condition. SELECT * FROM orders WHERE quantity > 1;|\n",
